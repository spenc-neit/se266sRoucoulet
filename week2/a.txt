Background
A small Healthy Living clinic has asked us to create a web application that tracks important patient physical characteristics and determines their Body Mass Index (BMI).

Application Requirements
Create a basic patient intake form with the following fields:

First name
Last Name
Married (yes/no)
Birth date
Height
Weight
When the form is submitted, you must validate for:

[x] First name cannot be an empty string
[x] Last name cannot be an empty string
[x] A selection must be made for the Married field
[x] Birth date must be a valid date
[x] Height must be a valid number 
[ ]  (No negative heights or mega-giants)
[x] Weight must be a valid number
[ ]  (No negative weights or unrealistically heavy weights)
Values for each of the form fields must “stick” when you submit the form.

Once the form is submitted without errors, display a confirmation page listing all the fields above along with the following:

Patient Age
Patient’s BMI with one decimal value
Classification of BMI
Helpful Information and Functions
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated as follows:

Weight in kg / (Height in meters)2
See also the NIH NHLBI information pageLinks to an external site..

Here are some important conversions:

kg = pounds / 2.20462
ft = 12 inches
1 inch = 2.54 cm = 0.0254 m
So, if I am 6" 1' and I weigh 180 pounds, my BMI is calculated as follows:

Height: 6" 1'  = 6 * 12 + 1 = 73 inches = 73 * 0.0254 = 1.8542 m
Weight: 180 pounds = 180 / 2.20462 = 81.64 kg
BMI: 81.64 / (1.8542 * 1.8542) = 23.7
The classification of the BMI is done as follows:

BMI          Classification
---------------------------
< 18.5       underweight
18.5–24.9    normal weight
25.0–29.9    overweight
>= 30        obese


Here are some functions that may help:

function age ($bdate) {
   $date = new DateTime($bdate);
   $now = new DateTime();
   $interval = $now->diff($date);
   return $interval->y;
}

function isDate($dt) {
   $date_arr  = explode('-', $dob);
   return checkdate($date_arr[1], $date_arr[2], $date_arr[0]);
}

function bmi ($ft, $inch, $weight) {
   // you will need to write
}

function bmiDescription ($bmi) {
   // you will need to write
}
